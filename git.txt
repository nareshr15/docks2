git remote add origin https://github.com/nareshr15/docksremote.git
git remote -v
	it shows
	origin  https://github.com/nareshr15/docksremote.git (fetch)
	origin  https://github.com/nareshr15/docksremote.git (push)
Now, if you delete the remote repo "docksremote" or 
     if you want to change the remote repo to other origin we have to use set-url command.

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/nareshr15/docks2.git
	set-url: it replaces the existing origin with new origin
git remote -v
	it shows
	origin  https://github.com/nareshr15/docks2.git (fetch)
	origin  https://github.com/nareshr15/docks2.git (push)
