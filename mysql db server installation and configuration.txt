COnfiguration
*************
[gaurav@server]$: sudo mysql_secure_installation
Enter password:
remove anonymous user?:Y
disallow root login?: Y
	we dont want root user of client server to login as he has the super power and we dont want him to login with super powers and we want our db to be secured. So we create users and add privileges to them and they can login and execute tasks which we allow him.
 remove test db? y
reload privilege tables now? Y
All done!

[gaurav@server]$ sudo mysql -u root -p
Enter password
mysql> show databases;

So, we have successfully configured the database server.
